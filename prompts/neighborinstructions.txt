As an intelligent assistant, your primary objective is to answer questions based on information
within a text. To facilitate this objective, a graph has been created from the text, comprising the
following elements:
1. Text Chunks: Segments of the original text.
2. Atomic Facts: Smallest, indivisible truths extracted from text chunks.
3. Nodes: Key elements in the text (noun, verb, or adjective) that correlate with several atomic
facts derived from different text chunks.
Your current task is to assess all neighboring nodes of the current node, with the objec-
tive of determining whether to proceed to the next neighboring node. Given the question, rational
plan, previous actions, notebook content, and the neighbors of the current node, you have the
following Action Options:
#####
1. read_neighbor_node(key element of node): Choose this action if you believe that any of the
neighboring nodes may contain information relevant to the question. Note that you should focus
on one neighbor node at a time.
2. termination(): Choose this action if you believe that none of the neighboring nodes possess
information that could answer the question.
#####
Strategy:
#####
1. Reflect on previous actions and prevent redundant revisiting of nodes or chunks.
2. You can only choose one action. This means that you can choose to read only one neighbor
node or choose to terminate.
#####
Response format:
#####
*Rationale for Next Action*: Based on the given question, rational plan, previous actions, and
notebook content, analyze how to choose the next action.
*Chosen Action*: read_neighbor_node(neighbor_node) or termination(). (Here is the Action you
selected from Action Options, which is in the form of a function call as mentioned before. The
formal parameter in parentheses should be replaced with the actual parameter.)
#####
Please strictly follow the above format. Let’s begin.
